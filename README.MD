## Tutorials
  Instructions are available both inside the game and in this manual.
  To access them in game, either use the top panel and click
    **Instructions > General**
    or click
    the **"Instructions"** button
    or at any point, use the keyboard shortcut
    **CTRL+I**

## General instructions
    In each game, you see a board of squares. Some contain bombs, others don't.
    If you click a square with a bomb, you lose. The objective of the game is to
    isolate all squares containing bombs, and click all squares that do not have
    bombs. Clicking a square that doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of
    adjacent squares that have bombs. Using this information, as well as some
    guess work and understanding of probability, try to avoid the bombs.

  CTRL+F can also be used to access the Flagging instructions:
    To Flag a square as a visual marker for a mine, right click it.
    Be careful though, since you can still left click it!

## Gameplay
    To play the game, just run the .jar file and choose either beginner or
    intermediate mode. The game works just as the instructions say. You can
    flag squares you think are mines with right click, and pick a square to
    choose it.

## Reset
    You will be forced to reset the game upon losing, but can also reset at any
    time via the big "Reset" button at the top of the screen. This option may
    also be found under the top panel at Options > Reset Game, or accessed
    via the shortcut CTRL+R.

  New Game:
    CTRL+N can be used to go back to the splash screen and start a new game,
    and this option may also be found under the top panel at Options > New Game.
